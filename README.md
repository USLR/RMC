# RMC

**RMC** or otherwise known as **Roblox Model Compiler** is a tool used by USLR to build Roblox lua projects.

## Usage

Requires only one parameter, the source directory of the lua files. Will automatically index all directories, convert them into folders and fill them. Outputs a build.rbxmx file in current directory.

## TODO

- Implement StringValue
- Implement NumberValue
- Use .lua suffix and require .<type>.lua suffixes instead of the current .<type> suffixes.
